            "video, and then some updates on the initiatives. Uh, Jen wanted a few minutes to talk about the writing style guidelines, and then the ongoing migration, Ritish will do a quick walk through of where we are. And then finally in the last five minutes, Amrita is helping us with some lighthearted activity. Thank you, Amrita. Okay. So, let's start with the org changes. So, couple of things, right? One is the consolidation of Construction, Energy, and Utilities teams into R team, right? I think they're emerging into our business unit. I think a month or a couple of months back, we saw at the higher level alignment in terms of the teams being aligned from an operations, project management, and engineering perspective. In the last month, has been discussion ongoing around how do we uh consolidate the PMO and the infra dev teams?  So they have their own documentation team. We have our own documentation team here, right? In fact, we have three teams here.  And the other unique aspect is their documentation team is parked under engineering, whereas we are under product management.  So I think finally what I heard from Don last week is it will stay as it is.  We will not merge the documentation teams for now. The three teams in Communications GUI will continue working as it is. No changes. And the documentation team and the Construction, Energy and Utilities will be reporting under Engineering, Matt B, and that will stay as is no change.\n",
            "\n",
            "In terms of the PMO, uh, there are a few changes. So, one is, uh, some of the PMOs, it seems like the kind of role, the kind of work that they've been involved is more inclined, more suited to the operations team, the business operations team. So some PMOs from CE, the construction, energy, and utilities, will fold in the business operations team.  And then there are a few other PMs who will fold within the communications team.  Exactly under whom they will roll and whom they will end up reporting is not very clear. There is a possibility that some of them may directly report to Sally, so that she gets a better understanding.\n",
            " of the overall business and so on. But that part is not very clear. And, uh, what else I Those are, those are the things that we have been discussing the last couple of weeks and, uh, that is where we are in terms of the construction energy and utilities. My understanding is in our next all hands from Andrew, early September, by that time, they should have fleshed out all the details, and they will probably flash a new org chart that is applicable for us. Uh, more consolidated view of all of the units put together. So, that is the first part of the org changes, which is about the construction energy and utilities.\n",
            "\n",
            "The next one, I think, needless to say, I'm certain all of us are, uh, are aware of a lot of new floating around in terms of layoffs and RIFs and different terminology being used. I also heard about these, but beyond that, we have no uh uh authentic confirmation on the same. The only thing that I've been trying very diligently to do is very regularly stay in touch with Don, just to get a sense of uh what's happening. Is there any latest information that he can share? And including, I think 30 minutes before this meeting, I Slacked him. And my point was, I have a team meeting. Is there anything else that you you have for me to share? And he said no new information, Amish. I do understand. I wanted to be very empathetic. I know this could be uh causing some anxious moments. for everyone.  I think, uh I know it can end up, uh, distracting many of us from the workspace as well. But uh, I think what is in our control is just continue doing the good work that all of you have been doing. Look at uh, other opportunities in terms of, uh, uh, understanding more on the AI front and see how we can use AI to amplify our deliverables, help moving on. That is, I think, nothing else that we can do at this stage.  My personal view is, I don't think so we should be impacted at all. But again, that's my personal view, right?  And it doesn't uh, matter, it doesn't count much. It's basically based on the work that we are doing, the pipeline of work that lies ahead for us, and the kind of deliveries that we have been doing all along. I think that's, uh, I I I think pretty much this is what I'd mentioned in my email as well to everyone. And then I've been trying to find some time and talk to many of you in person or Zoom wherever feasible. I think that's where we are.  Is that, is there a timeline for the activities to finish? Again, nothing very authentic but I'm guessing first week of September.  First week of September is when whatever uh uh is happening across everywhere, you know, it would uh complete, and so on.  That's my guess, because we're finishing our quarter end of uh by this week and early next week. So, generally these things they want to wrap up in that quarter so that, you know, they can um\n",
            " Make sure that the quarter data matrix is well represented, and then you start the next quarter on a, on a different slide, you say this, this is the new metrics and all of that stuff.  I think that's basically where we are. Absolutely. There's nothing, we are in touch regularly, there is no information, and at one point in time, Donald's saying, I think no news is good news, Ramesh. Don't bother. Keep moving.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yeah, I think that's primarily where we are.  I don't know if anyone has any questions.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay. I'll keep moving. If there's anything, feel free to let me know. I'm happy to talk to any of you later.\n",
            " as well at some point in time. Moving on to the next one, the Campus Vershers, F526, as we mentioned last, in our last meeting, we have been approved for five, five Campus Vershers to be hired and the breakup is finalized. Three of them will go to Suresh's team, one will go to Gil's team and one of them will come to RT. It's 311.  The hiring activities will start, this is August, in a couple of months from now. So there's still time for it. We'll have to then figure out and I will have to talk to Suresh and others as well to understand what is the thinking and so on, how do you want to execute this activity?  The third one is the TL9000 audit that Unified Assurance went through. So, as a first step, what I happens is internally a team will review the process. They will engage the stakeholders. They will review and they will determine whether this is appropriate or good enough to be showcased for next term audit.  The internal audit findings are, have been very impressive. Dominguez telling me that there's absolutely one or two very minor things, nothing in the documentation side. Currently, have a meeting with the internal auditors a couple of times, showcasing and demonstrating the doc plan page and all of the related artifacts. I think that went through very well.  So, what that means is, most likely, Unified Assurance will be a candidate for an external audit sometime early next year.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay. I think on similar lines, I saw, uh, I received a deck on, uh, ISO 27000.\n",
            " one. Uh, I thought it was a very informative deck and had all the information that is required for someone getting started on that uh audit, what that audit is all about and what is the scope of it. And typically, uh, what are the likely questions the auditor will ask? How do you prepare yourself for it? So I thought, uh, it'll be useful for some of us. I just shared that with uh everyone in the team here. There's nothing There's nothing that is lined up as an audit for us. But I'm guessing at some point in time, more and more apps, products will be introduced as a part of the audit. Now that UA has been introduced and is looking good, uh, definitely, um Certainly, the next cycle, there could be more apps, products involved in the audit. Okay. The next one is about AI. So So yesterday in Bangalore, some of us got together and we said, \"Let's uh, let's consolidate our learnings. Let's take a, uh, uh, feel for what is the progress each one of us have made. What are the use cases that we have worked on? What are the prompts? So, I think it turned out to be a good session. Each one of them had come prepared with the use case, the prompt, and observations, and what are the things to be kept in mind. So, uh, Simran facilitated that session, and all of us, uh, contributed by way of inputs in the form of use cases and prompts. So that, uh, really ended up being a very, uh, productive one. It looks like it's a good start for all of us to, uh, develop further. I shared those notes and, uh, the recording of the meeting and all of this stuff, the Confluence page. And many of us have some follow-up actions for the next\"\n",
            " this week to build on whatever prompts you have done because the AI can only help us uh based on the level and the quality of the prompts that we give. So, it's very important for us to understand, keep refining the prompts. So, all of us have had some actions to follow up on the prompts that was demonstrated, helping us to review and refine and showcase in the next meeting. So, we will, I've, I've just shared that with Manohar and Amanda. We'll just go through that. Just take a look and then we can talk on how we can expand and get all of us involved in in some form and then see as a team how we can move forward. And then finally the last one is about upcoming releases. So, I reached out to Danny early this morning. Uh one is uh just to check whether uh he is on the way to settling down. And he responded, he's still regrouping his team.  He's probably have some new members from other teams, I'm guessing. And, uh, uh what I wanted to ask him is we have around 11 releases in the next seven to eight weeks. So, couple of things, should we anticipate any impact uh, in terms of his team's support? And second is, is there anything that we can do uh, proactively as a team to help? And he was very curious to know about the releases. I sent the table of, uh, the 11 releases and the timelines. He'll probably come back. At least it gives him an idea of upcoming releases. And I told him of the 11, 10 of them are in SDL. There's maybe one release that will be in POC. Okay. So, I think these are There are a few things that uh I had from my end. If uh there are no questions we can move on to the next topic on monetization. Amanda, do you want to just give us a quick uh summary of uh what's lined up for us for the next few weeks?\n",
            "\n",
            "Sure, so uh good morning and good evening again to everyone. So uh this month, the BRM and OCIOMC writers have spent the majority of the month working on the 15.1 documentation repost. There's been a handful of really large features that were in it. Um almost all of the features have been reviewed and signed off. Proteksha worked really hard converting all of the WebLogic admin procedures to the new WebLogic remote console, and that impacted a lot of books and she also had the degraded performance of ECS nodes that she documented and got approved. Sumia did the new overload feature and got it signed off. And Parvathi had a large and complicated Kafka re-architecture feature that impacted like five, five books. Um, and so there was a lot of good work there. We're working hard to repost the 15.1 books by the end of this week. It's going to be close. Um, there are a few books we'll need to spill over into early September because, um, a couple are still in the review process and needed a little bit more tweaking. Um, some of the other writers have been working on 15.2 features: Manaswini on a large GL revenue feature and working on the collections configuration center help document for a new GUI. Simran on the absolute function for PDC and she's been providing feedback and reviewing the new GUI MPC wireframes that will be coming out in, I'm guessing 15.3 in a later release.  Um, also,\n",
            " and Ritesh have been working on the OCMC 15.2 features and still doing a lot of work on migration from SDL to Oak Foundation.  And this month, Shijin has continued to spend a lot of time on the migration of NCC and OC3C from Word to DITA to Oak Foundation.\n",
            "\n",
            "And that's it.\n",
            "\n",
            "Excellent. Yeah, so just to add on to the last one. So, uh, I think we had around 110 books in NCC to be converted from Word to DITA. After a lot of trial and error, uh, attempts, Shijin, Ritesh, and Sumana, they have completed that as I speak today. Today, they finished the last couple of books. So 110 books have been converted. Another set of 110 books remain on OC3C. The reason I'm sharing this is it should be a good\n",
            " information for Parvatha, she is getting ready for her set of books to be converted sometime soon. Looks like, you know, we have a good positive way forward, Parvatha.\n",

            "That's a positive note, Ramesh. It's good. Honestly.\n",

            "Okay.\n",
            "Okay. So, this is the dashboard that, um, we, uh, which we track our releases in the organization portfolio. We have a bunch of releases in October.\n",
            "OSM 8.1 planned for year 31st October, and then UMA in October,\n",
            "SDA 8.3, and NI 8.0, and Then we also have MS uh here and then uh we have uh DBE 2510 October and then we have in February insurance 6.11 of course, and then we also have uh um uh plan to repost UCS messaging server documentation in October. And uh and then this uh what used to be called restored as a node. So, it's called UniOps now, so we also they’ve been delivering this uh this solution just with one uh set of features, that's OTA, and then there's a new uh component or set of features that they’re developing that's called T2R, trouble to resolve, which is about ... about uh integration between Unified Assurance and UEM.  So currently, the team is um uh uh brainstorming how to deliver this uh solution to customers, and then most likely we will have this in uh December this year.  So I thought I'll show...there's a lot of, a lot of uh work, uh the team has been working uh on the uh on the features uh and bugs, and other um initiatives.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yeah, and then we see in October, as you all can see, we have a lot of production reviews, right?  For all these uh doc sets, right? Happening at the same time. We're also uh uh trying to see if we could use any of the AI tools to do some, uh...\n",
            " clear activities. So, uh, yeah, I think uh, yeah, that's all about uh, the rotation projects.  Any questions? No, I think it's a it's a busy time, right? I think I know at least three or four releases are on the same day, October 31st.  If I remember well, and I think some of them are early October. So it's going to be crazy, and that's the reason why I reached out to Danny just to check if, how is he, his team well equipped because generally they're very responsive for questions and uh, which is very important for, uh, release. So, email has been made already, effect. And then let's see if he comes back.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay, good. Thank you. So, with that said we'll move on to the initiatives. We have a bunch of, uh, special projects ongoing with specific focus. and uh very clearly determined outcomes and deliverables. All of that is aimed towards driving more consistency, more predictability, and making sure that our customers benefit from this. So, compatibility matrix uh uh Manjuswini and Parvatha. Yeah, go ahead.\n",
            "\n",
            "Hi. Uh so we have moved on to the phase three of this initiative where we are looking at all the uh like recently we started looking at the solution documents. And uh we do have a set of guidelines for the other documents. But this is a special set of docs, and we are trying to uh currently we are at this uh stage where we're trying to play around with AI and you know, come up with guidelines. We're not meeting the team like we did last year. So, it's just Parvatha and and I, uh, looking at this right now. So yeah, I will keep you guys in the loop for when we come up with the guidelines. So, yeah, so to add on to what Ministry said, so from the AI perspective, we are looking at a use case where we either provide you a prompt or or like an OCI service or something where you could even use that and run your compatibility matrix and check for all the alignment and you can collect it yourself and then send it to us for one round of manual review. That is something is what we are looking for. That's the outcome that we are looking for.  Either with prompts or something that you can run it by yourself. All of us can run it and then figure out whether the compatibility matrix is aligned with the standards. Um that's something that we are looking forward to. And we're also working on the solution as as she mentioned. We're also working on solution documents, compatibility matrix, samples.  To see if we can provide some guidelines and some standards to it. The way we present data can be similar across the board.\n",
            " Uh, that is what we are looking for. Thanks for mentioning. Yeah, I think that's interesting, right? To, um, to look at the guidelines and then keep that as a base and then every compatibility matrix that you get, you feed that, reconcile it with the base, and see if we can quickly highlight differences.  Exactly, exactly, Ramesh. That's what we are looking for. I mean, that's, that's the goal. Uh, we'll see we are very, very, taking baby steps at this point, right? So, yeah, we'll explore and get back to you guys.\n",
            "Yeah, yeah. Yeah, only thing is, uh, the chat.oracle.com, I think the more you use it, it is definitely one of the better options and everything that is available within Oracle today. Mm-hmm. But, uh it has a big downside as well.  It has, I know, it's all evolving. It's nowhere near the levels of maturity that we see in ChatGPT and other products, but, uh, Yeah. Yeah. Uh this But we'll try what we can. Yeah. We'll We'll see what we can do with what we have. Correct. No, absolutely. Yeah.\n",

As we all know, um this phase three includes maintenance of Phase one and Phase two as well as new card layouts uh for these set of products. Um not necessarily all of them are going by October timeframe which I'll cover in a while. Um while the maintenance of card layouts for Phase one, Phase two products includes, you know, adding more links and list related updates, icons. Uniformity, collect feedback, and prioritizing based on Adobe Analytics. Uh this area I just started because I was working on UI/IM updates. Uh it was in between this storm, the middle of that storm. So, I couldn't make any progress but I'll start working on this, looking towards this. Um while we have been identifying uh you know the the products that we can uh add or make updates to, you know, um for the corresponding releases and the current status of it. Um as we can see, you know, um there there are a lot of products that are in progress. Uh I would like to talk about um I would like to congratulate Lavanya for completing her uh uh adding videos uh on OSM. So, thank you so much Lavanya and congratulations on completing that. And I would like to congratulate Amrita on you know, uh collecting the feedback she has she's been successful up until now, you know. All of us have been trying to reach out to BDMs. and get some update or some feedback from them but none of us were able to get, but Anirudh was able to um successfully get the feedback so congratulations on that. As we can see, it's all appreciated. So well. Um and uh we're hoping that you know uh we've been reaching out to the PDMs and requesting them to check with the customers if they can. Uh but uh yeah, it's all in their hands now. Um I'm hoping that you know this Adobe Analytics data would help us with something, uh some concrete data that we can proceed with. It's all the uh I don't know like you know how how far will we be able to achieve that? That is still a question mark. That is still um yeah something that we'll have to find out. Um so that is the status up until now. I'll just talk about you know um the new products uh MSS UCSMS and CNAP. CNAP is already done. Uh during phase two itself, it is in, you know, that there's been considerable progress already on that part.\n",
            " Uh while for MSS and UCSM as you know the high level designs are done. Uh, there are a couple of products that are moved post October. Uh, AIA and UCS CS uh for uh uh because uh there is no CS uh release uh will be coming up post October, and same is the case with AIA, this will be coming in February 2026. So, uh we initially thought we'll be having it as a part of this and we'll have a high level, you know, run or like a uh uh how do I say that? Like another UI or or a page, you know, interface page ready for this, but uh then we thought, like, you know, because there won't be any content available, it's not, it doesn't make any sense at this point of time. So, the high level plan is already ready though. Uh, Manohar is driving that. Uh, so yeah, that's that's the status of cards layer.  Just speaking overall at a high level. That's good. So three out of five products on track and the two are being Uh rescheduled post October, right?\n",

            "Okay. That's good. Excellent. And, yeah, thank you. Thank you, Lavanya, for setting up the videos on the Oracle Health Center. I think probably one of the first products in the apps portfolio to have done this. I don't think the network products have anything of that kind yet. Excellent. And, Amritha, did you get all the feedback from Prakash?\n",
            "\n",
            "Yes, Ramesh, yes. He was the one that said it was a very good way to showcase our, I mean, showcase NICE's capabilities at the moment. And I asked him if there was any improvements. He said there was none. It was perfect.\n",
            "\n",
            "Good. So, I think you've, it's it's, the overall working relationship has turned, turned around, right?\n",

Okay, moving on, uh, KM articles, Simran Sharma. Yeah, so, uh, I have two updates on the KM articles. The first thing is that, uh, there were no metrics for August. I did that on purpose because I'd sent July metrics very delayed. So I thought, uh, let's send the next ones in, uh, the first week of September. So that's the first update. And the second thing is that, uh, on the monetization side, we're trying out something new. We're trying out like a pilot project for NCC and OC360 KMs, which is that, um, children has sent a list of the top 10 KMs and, uh, Ritesh is going to help us out here where he is going to to uh use uh the Oracle AI that we have, the new GPT one to get some draft already, at least something that's going to help summarize the game and put it in a structure that's going to be easier for children to review, and then we can take it up forward. So the entire process of framing, getting the first draft of game in through AI is something that we're testing out with Etsy and OC3 seats.  So, I'll keep you updated on that, and if that's successful, then maybe we can roll it over on the orchestration side as well. But that's an update for uh, monetization. And, China, you can take care of orchestration.\n",
            "\n",
            "Um, hello, good evening, everyone. \n",
            "Am I audible?\n",
            "Yeah, yeah. Go ahead.\n",
            "Yeah. So, a couple of few weeks ago I sent the orchestration team an email communication about uh, the game articles encouraging them to add more game articles on their respective product pages. Um, yeah. So I would request everyone to, you know, \n",
            " Start looking at the KMs, the most, uh, KMs which are the, you know, most highlighted, uh, most viewed by the customers. If they can start adding them, at least in progress. Uh, that's the one update about, uh, orchestration side. And also, if the pilot project, uh, for NCC and OC3C is successful, we can try that, uh, in the orchestration side as well.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yeah. So that's the update from orchestration side, Ravish.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay. So when are we going to send the metrics to Simran and Jona?\n",
            "\n",
            "First week of September. That's what I had planned. Because July, I'd sent it towards the end of July. So, it didn't make any sense to send July metrics again. Uh, so that's why I waited a bit. And, yeah, I think another thing, uh, was that, uh, there are still some products where we don't have any KMs documented. So, if we can, I said that in the last meeting, but just reiterating, if we can slightly prioritize those that need to be created.\n",
            "\n",
            "\n",
            "Yes, and\n",
            " Just to add to that, I think I shared this communication, uh, a month or two back. This did come up in one of the uh, quality review meetings. So a couple of things came up. One is around uh, doc bugs which are aged. I know we did this exercise much earlier, and we are pretty much clean. But on the monetization side, there was something that was pointed out to me, something which is five, six years old. And I was asked, are we working on this? Is it relevant? Do you want to check with engineering again and see, and so on. I think that was the trigger. And then these are the manual as well. I said why don't we just look from a monetization perspective as well? So that was one. And the other one was around uh, uh the, the KM articles. So I think the expectation is more and more KM articles will come into play, making sure that uh customers have their queries resolved in some form. Either in the in the form of a doc update wherever it's feasible, if not, a more authentic update in the form of a KM, that helps customers move forward in their journey.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay. That is good. Perfect, thank you. Both of you.\n",
            "What's the next one?\n",
            "\n",
            "Yeah, Jen. Lavanya, release notes standardization.\n",
            "\n",
            "Yep. Anything to share?\n",
            " Uh, so, I have nothing to share on the screen, but uh, but uh, so, what we're trying to, we started with is just trying to figure out what's, what, what's there, as far as release notes go. So, uh, there are 29 release notes, like, docs in this organization, which seems like a lot when you think about it.  And they range in size from two pages to 102 pages, literally. two pages to to a hundred and two pages. Um, and you know, some of them are book style, some of them are letter style, and some of them have this, and some of them have that, and so on. So what we're trying to do to start off with is just get a really good idea of what is there. Um, because for the release notes, we, you know, we want to standardize but we don't want to dictate, you know. So we we want to see what the kinds, what kinds of options that we're going to have, like, these sections are in all of them, so everybody should call them the same thing and put them in the same order. But for products that have other sections, then that's that's fine, too, but you know, maybe we should arrange them this way versus that way, or or something like that. So, um so basically, that's that's where we're at with that. And um, and I you know, and and I had a talk with with Carly about the you about the release notes for for UA. And as usual, UA is not like anything else.  <noise> That may just end up being a special case. <noise> Um, but but that's basically all we we do need. We at some point we need to meet with Parvatha because of of the of the things that are a little non-standard.  NSS seems to be uh, one of the mainly non-standard things <noise> and so we need to understand that too before we come up with come up with recommendations.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay. So you're basically in your initial phase of reviewing what is available and then trying to see you know what are the options, and we can keep on the table for the teams to Okay. Right. Yes. Because we're not You know, the the point of this initiative is to make it easier for customers, not to make it harder for us so <noise> we're not trying to make people's lives a burden to them so <noise> Sure.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay. Good. Thank you. Thank you, Jen and Lavanya.  On the next one, I think both of them are not there in the call today, but we did have a chat, and I think, uh, we did make some progress, and we'll continue to, uh, uh, talk more on this in the subsequent meetings.\n",
            "\n",
            "On the compliance front, uh, I'll just quickly talk about the monetization, and then Rahul can talk about the orchestration one.  So, uh, Sowmya is driving the security, uh, security checks for the RMS set of books. I think we had around 61 books, and the plan was to get them done from our end by the end of this week, and as I speak, we are well on track to get, uh, all of those done. So pretty much all the books have been reviewed. Sowmya is just doing a final filter, final view of all the responses, suggestions before we can, uh, deem close that activity, so that is in good shape.  And the other one is…\n",
            " The the big one, the NCC and OC3C inclusive language for the last uh couple of weeks, I'd asked Pratiksha to take it a little easy. We had a lot of the RMS 15.1 assignments going on and we wanted that to be focused. But, in good shape, she's just reconciling on and summarizing what are the doc updates that are required to be done, what are the code updates to be done, that will lead into two Jira issues for us to track and close.  And I know already some books have been updated.  Shumona has been helping us to update some of the books, as and when she gets some cycles. So, I think that has been also going on. Uh Manohar, on the orchestration, I know Deepak, Charma, they're all leading. Quickly want to just talk about it?\n",
            "Yeah, I'll briefly talk about some uh uh uh highlights. So, we've We have, uh, uh, IPSA docs, uh, the packet started, um, uh, reviewing the docs for inclusive language and, uh, security checks. So that's in progress. And then for AIA, we made some progress, and then, uh, some time back, and then, uh, that, that right now that's, uh, underway. So we're making progress, uh, on the AIA doc set as well. That's about inclusive language. So we'll, uh, pretty soon we'll have IPSA docs, and then AIA docs, right? Um, uh, ready and then reviewed for, for these checks.\n",

            " And then she's done extensive research and gathered some details, so which uh we'll roll up to the team very soon. Uh, these are going to help, uh, how we present our docs, right?

            "Hi, yeah, so I just thought I’d like to mention a couple things that I found in multiple different products, um, so that, you know, people can sort of proactively prevent me from having to say stuff.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, um, first of all, uh, in general, sections should be created using topics, um, rather than just section elements within the same topic. Um, the, the structure of them is, uh, visible in OHC when you use topics and so it’s easier for customers to navigate and understand what the, what the organization of the, of the doc is.  Um, and it's, of course, it’s easier to link them, especially from other docs if they are their own topics. Um, and it just helps people understand the context of the, of the different topics, to use topics rather than sections.\n",
            "\n",
            "If you do use sections, how-\n",
            " Deliver, um, the section headings are still headings. So capitalize them like section headings. I mean, capitalize them like headings. Um and speaking of headings, uh this is something that that uh, you know, the editors used to say years ago when we had, you know, full-time editors and I found it really annoying when they said it, and now I'm going to say it to you, and I'm sorry, it's probably going to annoy you too, but deliver on the promise of the heading. \n",
            "\n",
            "So if the heading of the section says that it's going to contain some kind of information, make sure that's the kind of information that the heading that the section actually has in it. Um, just, you know, sometimes you you you start off meaning to have the section be about one thing, and then the content sort of evolves over time from reviews and from just, you know, learning new information. And then the title of the section does not change and then now this title doesn't actually refer to the stuff that's \n",
            " currently in the section. So, so um, so, I know how you feel about that, that's, yeah, of course, of course, you're gonna do, but please do that. Um, also, uh, sort of relating to headings and topics, um, don't stack headings. Uh, don't put one heading right after another one. There should always be some kind of intro text, like a sentence or something. Um, and that's not just me, that's actually from the style guide. So, uh, I'm not making that up. Um, don't have one heading right on top of another heading. Always there should always be something in there. Um, and, you know, if you've got like one heading, and then another heading, and then another heading, and there's no parallel sections, then you need to think about moving them all up, moving that content up a lev- level.  Um, when you are, uh, when you're, when you're documenting a product, except in something, except in an online help,\n",
            " Um, don't describe what the software *does*. Describe what the user can *do with* the software.  Um, like if you've got, uh, like you can list the options available on a menu or a screen or something like that.

Um, don't, you know, I should have come up with, I should have brought an example here, and I, I didn't, I'm sorry. But, but, um, you know, in, in, in this paragraph, if you refer to, refer to this as the X component, don't in the next paragraph refer to it as the X feature, or, um, the X functionality, or, you know, use, refer to it the same way because otherwise, when people are reading it, they're not sure you're talking about the same thing. So, um, if you, like, just decide how you're going to talk about it, and then talk about it that way consistently. And then just one real quick\n",
            " Quick note then. Um, never use angle brackets to, uh, indicate variables. Just don't do it. We never, ever do that. They should always be, um, italics. Angle brackets should be, um, should be, should be, uh, reserved to things like XML, which actually has angle brackets in it, because if you use angle brackets to indicate a variable in a command, for example, um, the customers are not sure whether you're, whether they're supposed to put the angle brackets in or not. Um, they don't know, they, they don't understand for sure whether that's part of the command or just some sort of typological thing. So always use italics for that. Don't use, don't use angle brackets.  And, that's it, I'm done.\n",

Okay, thank you. Thank you, Jen. Sure. Sure. So, on the next one is the migration update, Ritesh. A quick status of our migration with the team, please? Yeah. So the migration is basically a large large process. If to say the least because it's not just product wise, it's also release wise. So we'll actually need to decide on what books of What releases need to be migrated? They're being reposted consistently. Things like that, so all of you need to just - I'm just informing so that everyone is aware of our tests, and if, when they are working on it, they will remember that they need to keep this in mind.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, other than that, uh, I've - we've totally migrated - we have 113 books that we plan to migrate in two sets - set one and set two - and they are across 10 products or 10 releases, essentially.  And 108 have been migrated, with five of them still having post-migration. So 103 have been migrated, and uh another, how, 13 are in the process of being migrated. So overall that is the status. We should complete set two *this* week, and set *three* will be starting out soon, and we will be rolling out into a deeper dive of BookF sooner.\n",

            "Yeah.\n",
            "\n",
            "Okay, so I...\n",
            " I think what is happening is of late, Dawkins' approach for migration is, they will, let's say I had ten books for migration, they will do the migration for three books, and then they will expect us to complete the post-migration for those three books, and *then* they would help do the migration for the next set of three books. So, they won't do it in an incremental way. They want to make sure that they don't finish all the migration in one chunk, and then we wait for the post-migration to be done in another chunk, only to discover some issues at the end, having the need to redo it again. So doing it in small chunks. So that's the approach that they're taking and that's precisely why it's taking time for us as well. They have been trying to rebalance and re-prioritize available workforce to help us on this front here. So, they're doing it in a piecemeal manner and we are progressing on that front here. So, hopefully as they said, in the next one or two days we should get done with this and then set...\n",

            "Yeah, yeah, sure. Uh, so I'll stop, I'll stop my screen. Yeah. I'll just uh Yes. So, as um Jen already said that it's everything is so different with UA, so I'll just start with that. This is just very different and weird. So you guys uh would be familiar with how we um write UI paths, right? So like, you know, if we want to go to device owns, that's an interface, and we would just write it instead. But, as you can see here, this is Cisco five implementation guide, and this is how it's written in the guide. Um so, if you click the link, it will just take you to the user's guide that talks about the device. on UI. But the format is like really off, and this is not how we usually document. So it was in our backlog, you know, to, uh, improve all this.  So as part of six one one, um, you know, six one release, actually we edited all the, um, all such instances in users guide, actually. So as you can see here, so okay, this is going to Yeah. So yeah, as you can see here, uh, instead of, like, you know, um, concluding it with arrow marks, what we have done here is that we've, like, you know, reformatted it to a sentence like this. So like going through like some 50-60 files in our, um, IntelliJ, um, folder and doing this is like a tedious task. We just, like, you know, so what we did was we tried to generate a code, uh, Using Oracle Code Assistant, this plugin is visible in your IDE, whether it's IntelliJ or VS Code, or whatever you are using.  You can chat with it and ask it to generate code.  Due to time constraints, a quick demonstration of generated code will be shown.\n",
            "\n",
            "So, this is a prompt, as you can see here. Step one, step two, through a conversation, in a conversational model, what was done was to make it generate code that would replace all instances of, you know, UI parts like *this* to something like *this*: to open this interface from the main navigation menu, yeah, with all the formatting that we needed.\n",
            " wherever we need, we need bold and wherever we need links to be added, all those things.  So, now I'll just get to the demo part.\n",

            "So I'm going to Implementation Guide folder.  Yeah. So this is Implementation Guide folder and I just wanted to show you, like, we have some 52 files within this and every file is a chapter.
